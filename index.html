                    I am a transfer student in my Junior year working on my BS in Computer Science.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    I was born and raised in Kansas City, MO (GO CHIEFS!) and attended Oak Park for high school. After high school, I took advantage of my A+ scholarship and attended Metropolitan Community College (MCCKC) at the Maples Woods, Penn Valley, and Longview campuses earning my basic AA degree. I previously have interned with Cerner at the World Headquarters Campus on the Quality Assurance Team, dealing with automation of software testing.  My hobbies include sports, video games and a bit of writing and photography although very little of both.

                  <h2>Post Grad Plans</h2>
                  After I graduate, I plan to look for a software engineering position. As I am from KC, Cerner is the obvious choice especially since I have previously worked there, however I am open to looking for other positions around the area. I would prefer to stay in that local area but if a great opportunity comes up, I would heavily consider it. My dream job is game development. I have played video games for as long as I can remember, and I would love to create the things that I love to spend my time on.
